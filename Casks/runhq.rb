  # RunHQ ships with an ad-hoc code signature rather than an Apple
  # Developer ID. Without this postflight, Gatekeeper would block
  # first launch with "unidentified developer" (right-click → Open
  # works, but it's a worse UX than a one-time xattr clear).
  # Clearing the quarantine attribute tells macOS to skip the
  # Gatekeeper assessment entirely — safe for apps installed via a
  # trusted package manager.
